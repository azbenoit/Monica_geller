  <p> Carlotta - General Secretary <br> <br>
    In one word, she is unfaltering. <br>
    She has already shown her leadership and problem-solving skills in our video! Carlotta 
    wants to lead by fostering the diversity of our team such that our skills and ideas can 
    complete each other and come to fruition. She has her priorities straight and is ready to 
    take on the challenge leading a team of nine represents. 
  </p>


  <p> Antonia - Events <br> <br>
    In one word, she is quite literally a 'machine'. 
     She hasn't let French be a barrier and is already involved well... everywhere! 
     Through this, she has already grasped what events students enjoy, and those that are now tradition. 
     She wants to organise events that work even more with our busy schedules, and those of the engineers. 
     Full of great ideas and open to new ones, she will be there to ensure everything runs smoothly (but not too much!). 
  </p>

  <p> Flavia - Internal Relations  <br><br>
    In one word, she is resourceful. With her easy-going yet purposeful personality, 
    she will be the perfect link between the Bachelor's students and associations 
    and the admin and AX. She wants to cultivate these connections so they run 
    smoothly all year round! 
  </p>

<section class="people">

  <p> Henri - Treasurer <br><br>
  In one word, Henri is deep-pocketed (if you seem what we mean ðŸ’¸). His connections and impressive resourcefulness will help maintain 
  and strengthen our current ties with our sponsors and build many new fruitful partnerships. 
  In this, he will enable us to have very diverse activities and manage well the resources we have for our community of students. 
  Finally, his determination is perfect to collect those lovely cotisations of yours! 
  </p>

  <p> Nicolas - Communications <br> <br>
    In one word, he is connected! 
    He has one goal in mind: ensuring our students' association will never feel disconnected from the day to day bachelor life. 
    He knows full-heartidly good communication is key and can make a huge difference.
    Hence, he will provide the most precise, transparent and close communication you have ever witnessed. You won't ever miss an event 
    or key information ever again! 
  </p>
  
  <p> Cha - Integration & Traditions<br><br>
    In one word, she is open. 
    A simple proof of this is the ease with which she interacted on the Telegram group before she'd even arrived on campus. 
    Even before having met her, most of us trusted her to be a friendly person. This is the energy she plans to bring into integration 
   to create a welcoming and comfortable environment for the new cohort. 
    She already has dozens of ideas in mind to make those sunny weeks of September unforgettable!
    As for Traditions, she is excited to be given something to build upon in our young Bachelor. 
    She aims to strengthen our current traditions and create fun new ones! 
  </p>

<section class="people">
  <p> Mia - Infrastructure & Operations <br><br>
    In one word, she is easy-going. In the hustle and bustle that is the 103, 
    she wants to nurture a cohesive atmosphere in the building so that everyone feels at home. 
    She strives to make sure everything run as smoothly as possible so that students can enjoy the 
    spaces available and just enjoy! 
  </p>

  <p> Jasmine - Committees & Binets <br><br>
    In one word, she is sociable. You may have seen her perform with her XPomPom team
    during the Speech Contest, but did you know she is in charge of this Binet? 
    Her unmatched motivation and sense of adventure have enabled her to be involved in 
    both Binets & Committees and a few months, she has truly gotten a sense of 
    these associations and how to animate and manage them accordingly. 
  </p>

  <p> Alix - Sports & Weekends <br><br>
  In one word, he is unstoppable. Many of you may know him as the dauntless rock climber,
   but he is brings that energy into every single sport! He is perfectly suited to get
   us those extra gym hours we've all been complaining about, and to multiply sports 
   opporunities within the Bachelor and with the engineers. Come enjoy the Death Workout with 
   him and you might just beat one of your personal bests!
