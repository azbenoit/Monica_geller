        <div class="textpeople left textphoto">Carlotta - General Secretary <br> <br>
            In one word, she is unfaltering.
            She has already shown her leadership and problem-solving skills in our video! Carlotta 
            wants to lead by fostering the diversity of our team such that our skills and ideas can 
            complete each other and come to fruition. She has her priorities straight and she is ready to 
            take on the challenge leading a team of nine represents. </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="textpeople right textphoto">Flavia - Internal Relations  <br><br>
            In one word, she is resourceful. With her easy-going yet purposeful personality, 
            she will be the perfect link between the Bachelor's students and associations 
            and the admin and AX. She wants to cultivate these connections such that they run 
            smoothly all year round! Just look at how she dealt with Sir Barth when the team was on the hunt for a treasure ;) 
        </div>

        <img src="person/antonia.jpg" alt="antonia" class="photo antonia">
        <div class="textpeople left textphoto">Antonia - Events <br> <br>
            In one word, she is quite literally a 'machine'. 
             She hasn't let French be a barrier and is already involved well... everywhere! 
             Through this, she has already grasped what events students enjoy, and those that are now traditions. 
             She wants to organise events that work even more with our busy schedules, and those of the engineers. 
             Full of great ideas and open to new ones, she will be there to ensure everything runs smoothly (but not too much!). 
          </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="textpeople right textphoto">Nicolas - Communications <br> <br>
            In one word, he is connected! 
            He has one goal in mind: ensuring our students' association will never feel disconnected 
            from the day to day bachelor life. He knows full-heartedly good communication is key and can make 
            a huge difference. Hence, he will provide the most precise, transparent and close communication 
            you have ever witnessed. You won't miss an event or key information ever again! 
        </div>

        <div class="textpeople left textphoto">Henri - Treasurer <br><br>
            In one word, Henri is deep-pocketed (if you see what I mean ðŸ’¸). His connections and impressive resourcefulness will help maintain 
            and strengthen our current ties with our sponsors and build many new fruitful partnerships. 
            In this, he will enable us to have very diverse activities and manage well the resources we have for our community of students. 
            Finally, his determination is perfect to collect those lovely cotisations of yours! 
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="textpeople right textphoto">Cha - Integration & Traditions<br><br>
            In one word, she is open. 
            A simple proof of this is the ease with which she interacted on the Telegram group before she even arrived on campus. 
            Even before meeting her, most of us trusted her to be a friendly person. This is the energy she plans to bring into integration 
            to create a welcoming and comfortable environment for the future BX25. 
            She already has dozens of ideas in mind to make those sunny weeks of September unforgettable!
            As for Traditions, she is excited to be given something to build upon in our young Bachelor. 
            She aims to strengthen our current traditions and create fun new ones! 
        </div>

    <div>
        <img src="person/mia.jpg" alt="mia" class="photo mia">
        <div class="textpeople left textphoto">Mia - Infrastructure & Operations <br><br>
            In one word, she is easy-going. In the hustle and bustle that is the 103, 
            she wants to nurture a cohesive atmosphere in the building so that everyone feels at home. 
            She strives to make sure everything run as smoothly as possible so that students can enjoy the 
            spaces available and just enjoy! 
          </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <div class="textpeople right textphoto">Jasmine - Committees & Binets <br><br>
            In one word, she is sociable. You may have seen her perform with her XPomPom team
            during the Speech Contest, but did you know she is in charge of this Binet? 
            Her unmatched motivation and sense of adventure have enabled her to be involved in 
            both Binets & Committees and in a few months, she has truly gotten a sense of 
            these associations and how to animate and manage them accordingly. 
        </div>

        <img src="person/alix.jpg" alt="alix" class="photo alix">
        <div class="textpeople left textphoto">Alix - Sports & Weekends <br><br>
            In one word, he is unstoppable. Many of you may know him as the dauntless rock climber,
             but he brings that energy into every sport! He is perfectly suited to get
             us those extra gym hours we've been complaining about, and to multiply sports 
             opportunities within the Bachelor as well as with the engineers. Challenge yourself to participate in the Death Workout with 
             him and you might just beat one of your personal bests!
